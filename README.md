## Battle
- Each combatant is displayed during the battle, with health shown below the fighter's name and how many frames the fighter has left before they can perform an action.
- Below this, it also displays what attack the fighter is going to take - in this case, the Rat AI has not yet decided what to do.
- If a fighter is defending while it is attacked, it takes no damage.
- If the player attacks an enemy with **8** frames or less, the enemy's action is cancelled and they become stunned, leaving the player a few extra frames to attack.
